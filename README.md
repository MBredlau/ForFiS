>This tool is still in progress. Feel free to add your issues and/or contribute in the software development by commiting

>This tool shall be used to compare your strategie finding algorithms to other state-of-the-art approaches. I'd appreciate, if you add your algorithm so that everyone can compare to it.

**ForFiS** is a Python tool to simulate forest fires along with firefighting agents with an interface for strategie finding algorithms. 
This tool is highly configurable, simplest by adapting parameters in the included `config.yaml` file. After configuring the tool to your desire just run the `main.py` script with the python 3 interpreter.
